#+TITLE: Lunarymacs

This is my Emacs configuration. Features:
- home-brew ~use-package~ and key-binding macros.
- A simple package manager cowboy.el that can install by package.el, git or url.
- Some on-site packages included in =site-lisp=.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
emacs
#+END_SRC

While Emacs starts, a lot of warning will appear saying package xxx is not installed. To install all the missing packages, type
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x luna-install-all RET
#+END_SRC
